# Downloading ring images for the advanced finetuning example

You can download these images from (temporarily removed) (4GB).

You can unpack it like so (replacing paths as needed):

    tar -xf Downloads/rings_images.tar.gz -C repos/zoobot/data/example_images/advanced

This will likely take at least a few minutes as there are about 90k images. You should see them begin unpacking immediately.

## DO NOT USE THESE RINGS FOR ANYTHING ELSE!

You do NOT have permission to share or use this copyrighted data for any purpose other than the finetuning tutorial.
They are included for teaching and reproducibility only!

The actual ring labels have since been superceded by new labels collected by Galaxy Zoo Rings.
You should use those instead.
They will be publicly released (as with all GZ catalogs).
